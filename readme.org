* Meson iPlug
  Creating audio plugins & standalone applications with the =iPlug= framework with =Meson= build system.

  Currently the only example is the IPlugControls as seen on https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/tree/4d7e86e7dacb35070f0bd3795b8bbc52a054a249/Examples/IPlugControls

  Using my [[https://github.com/actonDev/iPlug2/tree/feature/meson_build][iPlug 2 fork]]
  
* Roadmap
  - [X] Build APP & VST3 on windows
  - [X] Adjust fork to use the script for VST3 sdk
    automatically downloading the VST3 sdk (can build out of the box)
  - [ ] Build on linux
* Getting started
  See more in the [[file:examples/IPlugControls/]] readme in how to build. The following instructions are about setting up the dev environment.
** Windows
   Suggesting using [[https://www.msys2.org/][msys2]]
