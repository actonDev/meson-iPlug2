* IPlugControls
** Building (Windows)
   This following snippet supposes =visual studio= and =msys2= installed. The initial terminal is msys2 and later we use the =vcvarsall.bat= to make use of the =vs= backend in meson.
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session *vs-iplug-controls*
# visual studio command prompts
cmd //k "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
meson setup --backend vs build-multiple
meson compile -C build-multiple
    #+END_SRC

    And that's it! Note that in the =build-multiple= project you have the generated =Visual Studio= project so you can actually skip the =meson compile= command and build/run/debug the app from inside =Visual Studio=
